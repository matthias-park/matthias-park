# üí´ About Me:
As a front-end developer with three years of experience, I specialize in JavaScript, TypeScript, and several popular frameworks including React, React Native, and Angular. My skills also extend to the Flux pattern, RxJS, HTML5, SASS, Chart.js, JWT, node.js, express.js, and webpack.<br><br>At DFRC, I was responsible for developing their dashboard and captive portal pages for big data beacons, using Angular with TypeScript and React.js with class patterns. I enjoyed the challenge of creating complex and dynamic user interfaces that met the needs of our clients.<br><br>At Strivegaming, I collaborated with third-party companies such as Desert Diamond, Golden Nuggets, GPN, and DK to create and maintain their iGaming platform web services. I leveraged TypeScript, React, and Node.js to build robust and scalable solutions that met the demanding requirements of the gaming industry.<br><br>Throughout my career, I have also worked with third-party services such as Xtremepush for web push and messaging, Playbook Services, Smart Street for auto-complete address service, and more. I am familiar with GitLab Pipeline, AWS, Azure, Jenkins, Swift, Jira, and Figma, which enables me to deliver end-to-end solutions that meet my clients' needs.<br><br>I am passionate about creating engaging and seamless user experiences and always stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends in the field. I am a problem solver at heart, and I love taking on new challenges that push me to learn and grow as a developer. If you're looking for someone who can deliver high-quality work and a great user experience, I'd be happy to chat!
